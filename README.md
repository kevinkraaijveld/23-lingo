# 23-lingo

A simple word guessing game implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Description

The Lingo Game is a word guessing game where the player needs to guess a 5-letter word. The game provides feedback on the correctness of each letter in the guessed word. If a letter is correct and in the correct position, its background color will be light blue. If a letter is correct but in the wrong position, its background color will be yellow. If a letter is not in the word, its background color will be red.

Once the player guesses the correct word, a success message is displayed, and the option to retry the game is provided.
